FRONTEND PR NOTES - Courtney
=============================

CLEANUP BEFORE FINAL SUBMISSION
-------------------------------
1. Remove "Backend connected" status indicator
   - File: frontend/app.py (around line 958-962)
   - The try/except block that shows connection status in sidebar
   - This was just for development/debugging

2. Remove clear-all endpoint (testing only)
   - File: backend/app/api/endpoints.py (around line 398-407)
   - The /wardrobe/clear-all DELETE endpoint
   - File: frontend/api_client.py (around line 134-135)
   - The clear_all_wardrobe_items() method


FOR SATOMI (Database Work Needed)
---------------------------------
1. Outfit Name Column
   - Currently storing outfit names in the occasion field as a workaround
   - Format: "Outfit Name | Occasion" 
   - Location: backend/app/api/endpoints.py line 281
   - Need to run: ALTER TABLE saved_outfits ADD COLUMN name VARCHAR(255) DEFAULT '';
   - Then update the save_outfit and get_saved_outfits endpoints to use the new column

2. Edit Metadata Not Persisted
   - The Edit button on wardrobe items only saves to session state right now
   - Need UPDATE queries in backend for metadata fields (occasion, season, colors, notes)
   - wardrobe_items table has a metadata JSONB column but we're not updating it

3. S3 Presigned URLs
   - Currently converting S3 URIs to presigned URLs on every API request
   - This works but might want to consider CDN or storing public URLs instead


CACHING (KEEP THESE)
--------------------
- @st.cache_data(ttl=300) for saved outfits - prevents repeated DB calls
- @st.cache_data(ttl=60) for wardrobe items - shorter TTL bc presigned URLs expire
- @st.cache_resource for API client - single instance
- .clear() calls after save/delete - refreshes data when things change
